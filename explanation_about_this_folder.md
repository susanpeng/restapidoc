This folder is used to sync with the RESTAPI on GitHub.
After I deploy this REST API on Heroku, and connect the restful folder to Heroku's repo, I am not sure if I can still use the same folder to connect to the repo on GitHub safely without trouble. Due to the itme limitation, I haven't got time to figure this out.

So I temporarily create this folder, clone the old content of this API from GitHub. Then, used the new files (proved to be working) to replace the files with the same names in this folder. Finally updated the RESTAPI repo on GitHub.

That ensure the content in the repo on GutHub is recent and correct, as well as working version.
